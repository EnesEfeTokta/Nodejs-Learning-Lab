# 06 Rest API with JWT Authentication
In this project, we will create a RESTful API that uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication. JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It is commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web applications.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v12 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- A code editor (e.g., VSCode)

## Andpoints Covered
- `POST /api/login`: Authenticate a user and return a JWT
- `GET /api/profile`: Retrieve the authenticated user's profile (protected route)
